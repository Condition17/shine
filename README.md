# shine
Rails,AngularJS, Bootstrap and Postgres SQL expermental app.
In this application I played mainly with AngularJS, Bootstrap and Rails. I used Devise gem for user authentication, RSpec for Ruby code testing, Jasmine for testing my JavaScript and PhantomJS, Capybara and Poltergeist for headless acceptance tests.

TO DO:
- write setup instructions
- solve sprockets::FileNotFound error because of bootstrap-sass-official package
